.Net Core Server


A small web service for printing similar words in the English language.
Two words w_1 and w_2 are considered similar if w_1 is a letter permutation of w_2 (e.g., "stressed" and "desserts"). 

Algorithm description:
Initial in startup time:
	1.For each word in the “words_clean” file: 
		a.Sort the word's letters alphabetically.
		b.Enter the sorted word as a key to the dictionary, if not existed.
		c.Add the original word as a value.
Runtime gets request:
	1.Sort the word's letters alphabetically.
	2.Return all the permutations list except of the requested word.

Follow the below steps to run the application:

1.Publish application as a self contained application:
	dotnet publish -c release -r ubuntu.16.04-x64 --self-contained
2.Copy the publish folder to the Linux machine.
3.Install .NET Core Runtime.
4.Open the Linux terminal (CLI) and go to the project directory
5.Provide execute permissions:	
	chmod 777 -R ./WebApplication1
6.Execute the application
	./WebApplication1
	
Note1:The algorithm assume the string's length is not too long.
In case of a very long strings, it is better to change the algorithm into one that will include 
enconding that indicates the amount of apperences for each alphabetical char.
For example:
"bbaaaace" --> "a4b2c1e1"
Note2:For large words txt file better use DataBase.
Note3:For more statistics, it's preferable to use statistical tools.
